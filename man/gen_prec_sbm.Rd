\usage{
gen_prec_sbm(
  d,
  block.sizes = NULL,
  K = 3,
  prob.mat = NULL,
  within.prob = 0.25,
  between.prob = 0.05,
  weight.mat = NULL,
  weight.dists = list("gamma", "unif"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{An integer specifying the number of variables (dimensions).}

\item{block.sizes}{An integer vector (default = \code{NULL}) specifying
the size of each group. If \code{NULL}, the \eqn{d} variables are divided
as evenly as possible across \eqn{K} groups.}

\item{K}{An integer (default = 3) specifying the number of groups.
Ignored if \code{block.sizes} is provided; then \code{K <- length(block.sizes)}.}

\item{prob.mat}{A \eqn{K \times K} symmetric matrix (default = \code{NULL})
specifying the Bernoulli rates. Element \eqn{(i, j)} gives the probability of
creating an edge between vertices from groups \eqn{i} and \eqn{j}.
If \code{NULL}, a matrix with \code{within.prob} on the diagonal and
\code{between.prob} on the off-diagonal is used.}

\item{within.prob}{A numeric value in [0, 1] (default = 0.25) specifying
the probability of creating an edge between vertices within the same group.
This argument is used only when \code{prob.mat = NULL}.}

\item{between.prob}{A numeric value in [0, 1] (default = 0.05) specifying
the probability of creating an edge between vertices from different groups.
This argument is used only when \code{prob.mat = NULL}.}

\item{weight.mat}{A \eqn{d \times d} symmetric matrix (default = \code{NULL})
specifying the edge weights. If \code{NULL}, weights are generated block-wise
according to \code{weight.dists} and \code{weight.paras}.}

\item{weight.dists}{A list (default = \code{list("gamma", "unif")})
specifying the sampling distribution for each block of weights.
Its length determines how the distributions are assigned:
\itemize{
\item length = 1: Same specification for all blocks.
\item length = 2: First for within-group blocks, second for between-group
blocks.
\item length = \eqn{K + K(K-1)/2}: Full specification for each block.
The first \eqn{K} elements correspond to within-group blocks with indices
\eqn{1, \dots, K}, and the remaining \eqn{K(K-1)/2} elements correspond to
between-group blocks ordered as \eqn{(1,2)}, \eqn{(1,3)}, \eqn{(1,4)}, \dots,
\eqn{(1,K)}, \eqn{(2,3)}, \dots, \eqn{(K-1,K)}.
}
Each element of \code{weight.dists} can be:
\enumerate{
\item A user-supplied sampling function. The function must accept an argument
\code{n} specifying the number of samples.
\item A character string specifying the distribution family.
Accepted distributions (base R samplers in parentheses) include:
\itemize{
\item "beta": Beta distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rbeta}})
\item "cauchy": Cauchy distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rcauchy}}).
\item "chisq": Chi-squared distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rchisq}}).
\item "exp": Exponential distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rexp}}).
\item "f": F distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rf}}).
\item "gamma": Gamma distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rgamma}}).
\item "lnorm": Log normal distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rlnorm}}).
\item "norm": Normal distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rnorm}}).
\item "t": Student's t distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rt}}).
\item "unif": Uniform distribution (\code{\link[stats]{runif}}).
\item "weibull": Weibull distribution (\code{\link[stats]{rweibull}}).
}
}}

\item{weight.paras}{A list
(default = \code{list(c(shape = 1e4, rate = 1e2), c(min = 0, max = 5))})
specifying the parameters associated with \code{weight.dists}. It must follow
the same length rules as \code{weight.dists}. Each element should be a named
vector or list suitable for the corresponding sampler.}

\item{cond.target}{A numeric value > 1 (default = 100) specifying the target
condition number for the precision matrix. When necessary, a diagonal shift
is applied to ensure positive definiteness and numerical stability.}

\value{

\details{
\strong{Edge sampling.}
Within- and between-group edges are sampled independently according to
Bernoulli distributions specified by \code{prob.mat}, or by \code{within.prob}
and \code{between.prob} if \code{prob.mat} is not supplied.

\strong{Weight sampling.}
Conditional on the adjacency structure, edge weights are sampled block-wise
from samplers specified in \code{weight.dists} and \code{weight.paras}.
The length of \code{weight.dists} (and \code{weight.paras}) determines how
weight distributions are assigned:
\itemize{
\item length = 1: Same specification for all blocks.
\item length = 2: first for within-group blocks, second for between-group
blocks.
\item length = \eqn{K + K(K-1)/2}: Full specification for each block.
}

\strong{Block indexing.}
The order for blocks is:
\itemize{
\item Within-group blocks: Indices \eqn{1, \dots, K}.
\item Between-group blocks: \eqn{K(K-1)/2} blocks in order \eqn{(1,2)},
\eqn{(1,3)}, \eqn{(1,4)}, \dots, \eqn{(1,K)}, \eqn{(2,3)}, \dots, \eqn{(K-1,K)}.
}

\strong{Positive definiteness.}
The weighted adjacency matrix is symmetrized and used as the precision matrix
\eqn{\Omega_0}. Since arbitrary block-structured weights may not be positive
definite, a diagonal adjustment is applied to control the eigenvalue spectrum.
Specifically, let \eqn{\lambda_{\max}} and \eqn{\lambda_{\min}} denote
the largest and smallest eigenvalues of a matrix. A non-negative numeric
value \eqn{\tau} is added to the diagonal so that
\deqn{
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\dfrac{\lambda_{\max}(\Omega_0 + \tau I)}{\lambda_{\min}(\Omega_0 + \tau I)}
\leq \texttt{cond.target} \\[1em]
\lambda_{\min}(\Omega_0 + \tau I) > 0 \\[.5em]
\tau \geq 0
\end{array}
\right.
}
which ensures both positive definiteness and guarantees that the condition
number does not exceed \code{cond.target}, providing numerical stability
even in high-dimensional settings.
