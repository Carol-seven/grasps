\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer specifying the number of sample size.}

\item{p}{An integer specifying the number of variables (dimensions).}

\item{seed}{An integer (default = 1) specifying the random seed for
reproducibility.}

\item{block.sizes}{An integer vector (default = NULL) specifying the size of
each group. If \code{NULL}, the \code{p} variables are divided as evenly as
possible across \code{K} groups.}

\item{K}{An integer (default = 3) specifying the number of groups.
Ignored if \code{block.sizes} is provided; then \code{K <- length(block.sizes)}.}

\item{prob.mat}{A \code{K}-by-\code{K} symmetric matrix (default = NULL)
specifying the Bernoulli rates. Element (i,j) gives the probability of
creating an edge between vertices from groups i and j. If \code{NULL},
a matrix with \code{within.prob} on the diagonal and \code{between.prob}
off-diagonal is used.}

\item{within.prob}{A scalar in [0,1] (default = 0.25) specifying the
probability of creating an edge between vertices within the same group.}

\item{between.prob}{A scalar in [0,1] (default = 0.05) specifying the
probability of creating an edge between vertices from different groups.}

\item{weight.mat}{A \code{p}-by-\code{p} symmetric matrix (default = NULL)
specifying the edge weights. If \code{NULL}, weights are generated block-wise
according to \code{weight.dists} and \code{weight.paras}.}

\item{weight.dists}{A character vector (default = c("gamma", "unif"))
specifying the distribution family for each block of weights.
Its length can be: \itemize{
\item length = 1: same distribution for all blocks.
\item length = 2: first for within-group blocks, second for between-group
blocks.
\item length = \code{K + K(K-1)/2}: full specification for each block (see
Details).

\item{weight.paras}{A list (default = list(c(shape = 1e4, rate = 1e2),
c(min = 0, max = 5)) specifying the parameters associated with
\code{weight.dists}. It must follow the same length rules as
\code{weight.dists}. Each element should be a named vector or list
suitable for the corresponding base R generator.}

target for the precision matrix. A diagonal shift ensures positive
definiteness.}

precision matrix exhibits a block (group) structure induced by a Stochastic
Block Model (SBM).

\details{
Within-group and between-group edges are generated independently according to
Bernoulli distributions specified by \code{prob.mat}, or by \code{within.prob}
and \code{between.prob} if \code{prob.mat} is not supplied.

Conditional on the adjacency structure, edge weights are sampled block-wise
from distributions specified in \code{weight.dists} and \code{weight.paras}.
The length of \code{weight.dists} (and \code{weight.paras}) determines how
weight distributions are assigned: \itemize{
\item length = 1: same distribution for all blocks;
\item length = 2: first for within-group blocks, second for between-group blocks;
\item length = \eqn{K + K(K - 1)/2}: full specification for each block.
}

Block indexing for weight specifications uses \code{K} within-group blocks
with indices \code{1, \dots, K}, followed by \code{K(K-1)/2} between-group
blocks ordered as \code{(1,2), (1,3), \dots, (1,K), (2,3), \dots, (K-1,K)}.

The weighted adjacency matrix is then symmetrized and used as the precision
matrix \eqn{\Omega}. Since arbitrary block-structured weights may not be
positive definite, a diagonal adjustment is applied to ensure the minimum
eigenvalue of \eqn{\Omega} is at least \code{min.eig}. The covariance matrix
is then computed as \eqn{\Sigma = \Omega^{-1}}, and the data matrix \eqn{X}
is generated from a multivariate normal distribution
\eqn{X \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)}.
