Description: Provides a unified framework for sparse-group regularization and
    precision matrix estimation in Gaussian graphical models. It implements
    multiple sparse-group penalties, including sparse-group lasso, sparse-group
    adaptive lasso, sparse-group SCAD, and sparse-group MCP, and solves them
    efficiently using ADMM-based optimization. The package is designed for
    high-dimensional network inference where both sparsity and group structure
    are present.
