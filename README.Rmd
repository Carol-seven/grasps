The goal of **grasps** is to provide a collection of statistical methods that
incorporate both element-wise and group-wise penalties to estimate a precision
matrix, making them user-friendly and useful for researchers and practitioners.


## Penalties


The package **grasps** provides functions to estimate precision matrices using
the following penalties:


1. Adaptive lasso [@zou2006adaptive;@fan2009network]

2. Lasso [@tibshirani1996regression;@friedman2008sparse]

3. Minimax concave penalty (MCP) [@zhang2010nearly]

4. Smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) [@fan2001variable;@fan2009network]


## Installation


You can install the development version of **grasps** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Carol-seven/grasps")
```


## Example


```
library(grasps)

set.seed(1234)

X <- matrix(rnorm(200), 10, 20)
membership <- c(rep(1,5), rep(2,5), rep(3,4), rep(4,6))

res <- grasps(X, membership = membership, penalty = "lasso", crit = "BIC")
```
