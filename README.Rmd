The goal of **grasps** is to provide a collection of statistical methods that
incorporate both element-wise and group-wise penalties to estimate a precision
matrix, making them user-friendly and useful for researchers and practitioners.


## Penalties


The package **grasps** provides functions to estimate precision matrices using
the following penalties:


1. Adaptive lasso [@zou2006adaptive;@fan2009network]

2. Lasso [@tibshirani1996regression;@friedman2008sparse]

3. Minimax concave penalty (MCP) [@zhang2010nearly]

4. Smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) [@fan2001variable;@fan2009network]


## Installation


You can install the development version of **grasps** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:


```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Carol-seven/grasps")
```


## Example


```{r}
library(grasps)

## reproducibility for everything
set.seed(1234)

## block-structured precision matrix based on SBM
sim <- gen_prec_sbm(d = 100, K = 5,
                    within.prob = 0.5, between.prob = 0.05,
                    weight.dists = list("gamma", "unif"),
                    weight.paras = list(c(shape = 20, scale = 5), c(min = 0, max = 1)),
                    cond.target = 100)

## synthetic data
library(MASS)
X <- MASS::mvrnorm(n = 50, mu = rep(0, ncol(sim$Sigma)), Sigma = sim$Sigma)

## solution
res <- grasps(X = X, membership = sim$membership, penalty = "lasso", crit = "BIC")
plot(res)
```
